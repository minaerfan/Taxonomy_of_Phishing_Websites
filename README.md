# Taxonomy Of Phishing Websites Based On Their Ownership Types

Phishing is a persistent and evolving threat that continues to pose significant challenges to internet users. Cybercriminals use various strategies to launch their phishing websites. This study seeks to quantify the proportion of phishing attacks that utilize dedicated, attacker-owned domains. By developing a taxonomy of phishing website ownership types, this study analyzes the percentage of phishing attacks that involve domains directly controlled by the attackers, versus those hosted on compromised or third-party hosting platforms. By understanding the distribution of phishing websites based on their ownership characteristics, researchers can better tune detection mechanisms to the specific attributes of each category.  

## Introduction

In this project, we developed a taxonomy to categorize phishing websites into three distinct groups: Attacker- Owned Domains, Hosting Platforms, and Compromised Domains. This taxonomy was achieved by designing a set of heuristic features for each category, providing valuable insights into the diversity of phishing activities.

## Methodology

This project employs a rule-based taxonomy as well as unsupervised and supervised machine learning  approaches to categorize phishing websites based on their ownership type. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies (Indicated in each source code file) installed. Dependencies include:
  - Python3 (The project has been tested on Python 3.12)
  - Scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - SHAP
  - matplotlib
3. Navigate to directories in the cloned repository. 
4. You can find the source code in the 'src' and the dataset in 'data' directories.
5. Open ipynb file.
6. Execute the  Jupyter Notebook cell by cell. (Results will be saved in the 'data' directory)
7. Analyze the results.
